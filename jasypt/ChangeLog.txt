1.2
=======

- Refactored the org.jasypt.util package: created util.digest, util.password,
  and util.text packages, and moved existing util classes to their corresponding
  packages. Also created PasswordEncryptor and TextEncryptor interfaces,
  to unify both basic- and strong-encryption implementations.
- Added org.jasypt.util.password.ConfigurablePasswordEncryptor for a more
  configurable (yet easy) way of using a password encryptor.
- Added binary utils for easy encryption of binaries.
- Added numeric encryption functionalities (both for integer and decimal
  numbers). This means new StandardPBEBigIntegerEncryptor and 
  StandardPBEBigDecimalEncryptor (for BigDecimals) in the 
  org.jasypt.encryption.pbe package, and also new util.numeric package with 
  easy utils for numeric encryption.


1.1
=======

- Added org.jasypt.util.StrongPasswordEncryptor as a util class for
  easy password encryption using a stronger algorithm.
- Added org.jasypt.util.MessageDigester as a util class for
  creating simple binary message digests.
- Added org.jasypt.digest.config.EnvironmentDigesterConfig and
  org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.config.EnvironmentPBEConfig for configuration
  of encryptors and digesters using environment variables and system properties.
- Objects of class org.jasypt.util.PasswordEncryptor now initialize their
  internal StandardStringDigester at instance creation.
- Made org.jasypt.digest.config.DigesterConfig and 
  org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.config.PBEConfig extend java.io.Serializable
