1.7
===
- Fixed Hibernate 3.6 compatibility
- Removed dependencies on commons-lang and commons-codec. Jasypt can now operate
  without depedencies on JDK version >= 6.
- Added class org.jasypt.registry.AlgorithmRegistry with utility methods for 
  obtaining the names of all the available digest/PBE algorithms.
- Created "lite" .jar package including only standard String and Byte digest and 
  encryption: no BigDecimal or BigInteger encryption, no "util" package, 
  no Spring/Hibernate/Wicket integrations, no Web PBE configuration, no CLI utils, 
  no properties encryption, no Zero salt generator.
- Added method "getInvertPositionOfSaltInMessageBeforeDigesting()" to DigesterConfig
  and "setInvertPositionOfSaltInMessageBeforeDigesting(...)" to StandardByteDigester 
  and StandardStringDigester in order to being able to append the salt after the message
  before digesting instead of the default behaviour (insert it before the message).
  This is useful for enhancing compatibility with some common LDAP password encryption
  schemes like {SSHA}.
- Added method "getInvertPositionOfPlainSaltInEncryptionResults()" to DigesterConfig
  and "setInvertPositionOfPlainSaltInEncryptionResults(...)" to StandardByteDigester 
  and StandardStringDigester in order to being able to append the plain (unhashed) 
  salt after the digest instead of the default behaviour (insert it before the digest).
  This is useful for enhancing compatibility with some common LDAP password encryption
  schemes like {SSHA}.
- Added method "getUseLenientSaltSizeCheck()" to DigesterConfig and 
  "setUseLenientSaltSizeCheck(...)" to StandardByteDigester 
  and StandardStringDigester in order to allow digesters to check digests created
  with any size of salt (not equal to the value set for the "saltSizeBytes" property).
- Added an "org.jasypt.util.password.rfc2307" package containing utility classes for
  password encryption operations according to common LDAP schemes like {MD5},
  {SHA}, {SMD5} and {SSHA}.
- Rebuilt CLI scripts: now both Windows and Linux versions can be run from outside
  the "bin" folder. New configuration parameters added.
- Added "listAlgorithms" CLI command that lists all digest and PBE algorithms
  present in the Java Virtual Machine.
- Rebuilt zip distribution package: remove unneeded "cli-bundle" and added icu4j 
  to libs.
- Added org.jasypt.spring.properties.EncryptableServletContextPropertyPlaceholderConfigurer
  as a sublass of org.springframework.web.context.support.ServletContextPropertyPlaceholderConfigurer,
  for transparent decryption of servlet context init parameters (like the ones in web.xml).
- Added org.jasypt.spring.properties.EncryptablePreferencesPlaceholderConfigurer
  as a subclass of org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PreferencesPlaceholderConfigurer,
  for transparent decryption of preferences set with JDK 1.4's Preferences API.

1.6
===
- Modified Class.forName calls to use current thread's context classloader.
- Fixed JavaDoc for Spring Security -related classes.
- Added missing registerPBE*Encryptor methods in HibernatePBEEncryptorRegistry

1.5
===
- Dependency on ICU4j made optional in Java 6 environments.
- Created new versions of old ACEGI's PasswordEncoder and PBEPasswordEncoder
  for Spring Security 2.x in package org.jasypt.spring.security2.
- Random number generation algorithm can now be specified in RandomSaltGenerator.
- Fixed bug in .sh files in the bin folder. $@ did not work with inputs that
  contained spaces and had to be substituted by "$@".

=======
- Fixed bug in EncryptedPasswordC3P0ConnectionProvider which made decryption
  of datasource configuration not to work properly.

1.4
=======
- Added methods to Simple* and Environment* config classes for both Digesters 
  and PBEEncryptors to allow them to be configured entirely with Strings.

  for Sun JCE's bug 4953555 (http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4953555)   
- Added org.jasypt.properties.EncryptableProperties as a java.util.Properties
  which allows transparent decryption of encrypted property values.
- Moved org.jasypt.hibernate.ParameterNaming to 
  org.jasypt.hibernate.type.ParameterNaming.
- Added org.jasypt.hibernate.connectionprovider.EncryptedPasswordDriverManagerConnectionProvider
  and org.jasypt.hibernate.connectionprovider.EncryptedPasswordC3P0ConnectionProvider
  for allowing encrypted datasource parameters in hibernate.cfg.xml 
  files.
- Added org.jasypt.spring.properties.EncryptablePropertyPlaceholderConfigurer
  and org.jasypt.spring.properties.EncryptablePropertyOverrideConfigurer
  to allow use of encrypted .properties files from within Spring applications
  in a transparent manner.
- Package org.jasypt.springsecurity renamed as org.jasypt.spring.security, and
  deprecated classes in the old package (will be removed in 1.5).
- Added org.jasypt.salt.ZeroSaltGenerator for creating salts filled with
  "zero" bytes.
- Added org.jasypt.intf.service.JasyptStatelessService for supporting CLI
  operation and development of stateless services (like web services) for
  Jasypt.
- Added org.jasypt.intf.cli.JasyptStringDigestCLI, 
  org.jasypt.intf.cli.JasyptPBEStringEncryptionCLI and 
  org.jasypt.intf.cli.JasyptPBEStringDecryptionCLI to allow the execution of
  digest, encryption and decryption commands from the command line, useful
  for knowing which value to write in an encrypted .properties file.
- Created new zip distribution containing convenience .sh and .bat files for 
  executing CLI tools.


1.3.1
